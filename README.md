<h2> Challenges </h2>
Building the matrix for the calendar was the most challenging part of this porject. I first needed to research JavaScrupt open source code. I deciced to go with moment.js to build the custom time and formatting for the calendar. Next I research different code for building matrix. I learned how to effictively build a matrix that displays the data how I intended. This took a lot of trial and error to get it correct.
